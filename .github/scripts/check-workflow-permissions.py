"""The workflow invariants of #8, checked on every run so they cannot rot:

- no pull_request_target or workflow_run triggers;
- every workflow's top-level permissions are exactly contents: read;
- packages: write and attestations: write only in build.yml, contents: write
  only in release.yml, security-events: write only in scorecard.yml,
  id-token: write only in jobs that exchange the OIDC token;
- actions: write only in the job of preview-cleanup.yml that cancels waiting
  runs (ADR-012 §8), and that job is what is written down here and nothing
  more: a checkout of the scripts and one script, the run's own token, no
  environment and no secret, its condition, its runner and its shell to the
  letter, in a workflow no pull request starts. What the script does is not
  held here: that is its test's and the review's;
- a job's permissions are a list of scopes, never a word (write-all), and a
  job that calls a reusable workflow is held to the same scopes;
- every checkout sets persist-credentials: false;
- every third-party action is pinned to a 40-character commit SHA.
